          The Gibson ES-335 is the world's first commercial semi-hollowbody
          electric guitar, sometimes known as semi-acoustic. Released by the
          Gibson Guitar Corporation as part of its ES (Electric Spanish) series
          in 1958, it is neither fully hollow nor fully solid; instead, a solid
          maple wood block runs through the center of its body. The side "wings"
          formed by the two "cutaways" into its upper bouts are hollow, and the
          top has two violin-style f-holes over the hollow chambers.[1] Since
          its release, Gibson has released numerous variations of and other
          models based on the design of the ES-335.

          Before 1952, Gibson produced only hollow-body guitars, which are prone
          to feedback when amplified loudly. That year saw the introduction of
          their first solid-body, the Gibson Les Paul, a significantly different
          instrument from Les Paul's early electric guitar experiment, "The
          Log", which consisted of a center block with detachable chambers on
          both sides,[6][7] a neck, hardware, and a pickup attached. By 1958
          Gibson was making a few solid-body models which had much lower
          feedback and better sustain but lacked the darker, warmer tone and
          unamplified volume of hollow bodies. The ES-335 was an attempt to find
          a middle ground: a warmer tone than a solid body produced with almost
          as little feedback. Though semi-hollow-bodies like the ES-335 are
          essentially a compromise of earlier designs, they are for this reason
          extremely flexible, as evidenced by the ES-335's popularity in a wide
          range of music, including blues, jazz, and rock. With a basic price of
          $267.50, it quickly became a best-seller, and has been in continuous
          production since 1958. The first major update came in mid 1962, with
          the most visible change being the neck markers: early models had dots
          (hence "dot neck"), later models had bloc
